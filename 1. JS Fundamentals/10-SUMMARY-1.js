/*

There are 8 data types:

number -> for both floating-point and integer numbers,
bigint -> for integer numbers of arbitrary length,
string -> for strings,
boolean -> for logical values: true/false,
null -> a type with a single value null, meaning “empty” or “does not exist”,
undefined -> a type with a single value undefined, meaning “not assigned”,
object and symbol -> for complex data structures and unique identifiers, we haven’t learnt them yet.
The typeof operator returns the type for a value, with two exceptions:

typeof null == "object" // error in the language
typeof function(){} == "function" // functions are treated specially
