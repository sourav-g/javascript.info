//? To fully enable all features of modern JavaScript, we should start scripts with "use strict".

// The directive must be -
//at the top of a script or
//at the beginning of a function body.

//Some modern features of the language (like classes) enable strict mode implicitly.

/*
JavaScript's strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "sloppy mode".

Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:

1. Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
2. Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
3. Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
